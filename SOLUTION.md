# Solution Steps

1. 1. Define an enum 'ReportStatus' with IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, and FAILED values to represent the current status of a report.

2. 2. Create a 'ReportResult' class to hold either the generated report data (if successful) or the exception that occurred (if failed).

3. 3. Implement a 'ReportInfo' class to track the current status and result of a report. Make its status and result fields thread-safe using 'volatile' and synchronized accessors/mutators as needed.

4. 4. Implement the 'ReportManager' class. Use a ConcurrentHashMap to store mapping from tracking IDs to their ReportInfo. Use an ExecutorService to run background report generation tasks asynchronously. When 'submitReportGeneration' is called, generate a new tracking ID, create a ReportInfo as IN_PROGRESS, and submit a task for report generation (simulating a time delay and possible failure). Update the ReportInfo accordingly upon completion.

5. 5. Provide a 'getReportInfo' method to let users retrieve the current status/result by tracking ID. Implement 'shutdown' to gracefully terminate the ExecutorService.

6. 6. Implement the console application class 'AsyncReportGeneratorApp' to provide a simple interactive menu: (1) submit a new report (which returns a tracking ID), (2) check the status/result for a given tracking ID, (3) exit/shutdown the app. Handle invalid tracking IDs and present appropriate status, result, or error messages to the user.
